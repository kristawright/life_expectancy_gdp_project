# Life Expectancy and GDP Analysis

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook, `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb`, contains an analysis of the relationship between life expectancy and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) across various countries. The analysis involves data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling to understand how GDP influences life expectancy.

## Contents

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**
    - Loading the dataset.
    - Handling missing values and data inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Descriptive statistics.
    - Visualizations to explore the distribution and trends in the data.
3. **Statistical Analysis**
    - Correlation analysis to examine the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
    - Regression modeling to quantify the impact of GDP on life expectancy.
4. **Conclusions**
    - Summary of findings.
    - Implications of the results.


## Data

The dataset used in this analysis should be in the same directory as the notebook. Ensure the dataset file is named correctly and its path is properly referenced in the data loading section of the notebook.

## Visualization

The notebook includes various visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and regression plots to illustrate the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
